## MVP

The MVP must be able to correctly rate some content properly, with our scale. The version must realize some basic features:

### AI(updatable)
- [ ] Fair evaluation by AI, in a scale of 1-6(According to the basic grades of English knowledge levels (A1-C2))
- [ ] Suggest a user content, that he wants to receive(films, books, courses, articles and etc.) 
- [ ] Prepare program education program, related with collected internet content

### Front-End(updatable)
- [ ] User profile page, with opportunities to change his data and content preferences that he wants to receive
- [ ] Main page with feature to choose a content that will be listed as interest
	-Probably it will not be a main page, just a modal window with small questionnaire about user
- [ ] Study page in where you can find all content related to learning a language of interest

### Back-End(updatable)
- [ ] Basic models for all needs(ORMModel, Pydantic): Users, Content, Languages and etc
- [ ] Bacis CRUD for generator content provided by a server
- [ ] User page logic, all validation, all db checks.
